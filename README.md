# Read more for Less

  

![Project Mock-up](static/images/intro-readme.png)

  
Read more for Less is a project where users can subscribe to get a box of books every month. To don't get any random book, users are able to set their preferences, such as genre, authors and books the enjoyed. Also, the website has a Book Club page, where users can create reviews about the books they are reading and discuss it with other users.

### 1. Strategy

As a person that loves to read, sometimes I spend more time looking for new books than actual reading. Keeping that in mind Read more for Less was created to facilitate chose a book. As time is a priceless asset, the users only need to provide information on what genre of books they like. If they want, they also can inform the authors and books they enjoy for a more precise chose.
  
####  Site Goals

- Provide an easy navigation website.

- Provide a platform where users can create a book reviews and interact with other users.

- Give a way to users easily choose a plan and checkout.

  

### 2. Scope

- Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django.

- Website information clearly relayed upon entering the home page.

- Easy way to Sign Up, Log in and Log out.

- Easily purchase a plan. 

- Allow users to create, read, update and delete reviews.

- Allow users to comment in reviews from other users.

### 5. Surface

The overall UX is clean and similar in all pages to keep consistency.

  

### Colors:

Following the biggest social-media(Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). **(#2D88FF)** was chosen a base color. In general, blue colours show trust to the users and fit perfect for this project. All the other colours were chosen to keep harmony with the base colour, and also keep the project consistent and elegent.

### Typography :

#### Content
- Logo - "Merriweather" font (with fall-back font of Serif). A mordern font created especialy for screen was a perfect choice for the logo.

- Navigation Links and Buttons - "Josefin Sans" font (with fall-back font of Serif).  A geometric, elegant and kind of vintage font.  It has a great style and fit perfect for the website

- Content - "Montserrat" font (with fall-back font of Serif). A classic the never get's old, was chosen for the general content for its readability, especialy in small screens.

## Project barriers and solutions

- Was hard to figure out how to save the start_date and end_date in the Order model as they were not part of the OrderForm. I easily managed to create the variables start_date and end_date, my first option was to include the form_data in the checkout function in the checkout app, but as the start_date and end_date was part of OrderForm it wasn't saving. So I decided to add the start_date and end_date as fields of the OrderForm and add hidden input fields in the checkout template, but it also did not work. In the end, I have the idea to add the variables after creating the form and order. And then setting the variables.

  

## Deployment

  

### Project Creation

- To create this project the [CI Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

- I was then directed to the create new repository from template page and entered in my desired repository name, then clicked create

repository from template button.

- Once created, I navigated to my new repository on GitHub and clicked the Gitpod button which built my workspace.

  

### Deployment to Heroku

This project is deployed and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

- Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and login.

- On the dashboard, click on the 'New' button and select 'Create new app'.

- Enter the app name and select a region.

- Under the 'Settings' tab, click on 'Config Vars' to add Configuration Variables from the env.py file. This includes the IP, Port,

Secret key, MongoDB name and URI, as well as mail settings for Flask Mail.

- In the menu select the 'Deploy' option.

- Under 'Deployment method' select the GitHub option to connect to your GitHub repository. Ensure GitHub username is selected and

use the search function to find the relevant repository.

- Select Automatic deploys from the main branch and click 'Deploy Branch'.

  

### Cloning

- The code can be run locally through clone or download from the repository on GitHub.

- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

- The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your CLI with **git clone <url>**.

- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine. The files can then
